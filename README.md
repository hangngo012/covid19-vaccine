This project researches about human responses to the first wave of COVID-19 and the influence of socio-economic influences on perceived stress. 

The outbreak of coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, in China in early December 2019 was rapidly transmitted globally, and on 11 March 2020, it was claimed to be a pandemic by WHO. Despite the universal experience of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated restrictions, there were individual differences in pandemic worry (Barber and Kim, 2020), compliance, trust in countryâ€™s protective measures, perceived stress and loneliness. Moreover, disadvantaged socio-economic position also create ununiformed behavior responses to COVID-19 pandemics. Therefore, this research is an attempt to understand the behavioral response and its socio-economic drives across different countries and cultures at the beginning of this pandemic. In this research, we propose to answer two research questions: 
1)	Around the world, what are the types of behavioral response to the beginning of COVID-19? 
2)	How does socio-economics factors affect stress in developed and developing countries?  

The dataset that I analyzed is COVIDiSTRESS data aset, which is a global survey from 39 countries and regions, with a large number of demographic data collected alongside with preceived stress level. To answer the first research question, I used PCA and K-means clustering. To answer the second research question, I used multivariate regression model.
